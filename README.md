# big-data-challenge
The Big-Data-Challenge project is designed to test my ETL skills using Amazon shopper product reviews by using AWS and google collab to perform an ETL process completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance.
# Data
The data used were the video games and watches dataset:
* Video games - https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz
* Watches - https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv.gz
# ETL Workbook
The ETL workbook can be found in the *Level 1 Folder*:
* *video_games_analysis.ipynb*
* *watches_analysis.ipynb*
# Resources
In the *Resources Folder*, you can find the schema for the tables that the data were transformed into.
